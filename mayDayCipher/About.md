# Cipher Decoding with Ruby

### MayDay Code Challenge

I have a set of ciphers that I am trying to decode, and for this task, I am utilizing the Ruby programming language. These ciphers are encrypted using the TFCCTF standard, which originated from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

To provide context about CTF, it is an ideal platform for both beginners to learn cybersecurity skills and experts to test and showcase their proficiency.
