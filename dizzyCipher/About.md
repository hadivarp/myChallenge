# Cipher Decoding with Ruby

### Dizzy Code Challenge

I have a set of ciphers that I am trying to decode, and for this task, I am utilizing the Ruby programming language. These ciphers are encrypted using the TFCCTF standard, which originated from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. 

To provide context about CTF, according to [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/), it is an ideal platform for both beginners to learn cybersecurity skills and experts to test and showcase their proficiency.
