# My Code Challenge

Welcome to my code challenge repository! Here, I've taken on the task of solving programming problems that have caught my interest. The solutions are implemented in languages I am familiar with, or at least those I believe I understand. These questions are distinct from those found on platforms like Euler Project or LeetCode; instead, they are sourced from various places, often discovered through sources like [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp75eufhOLc&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E).

## Question Sources

- **Dizzy Problem**

  The first set of questions comes from [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp75eufhOLc&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E). As Jadi's repository is not regularly updated, I've chosen to save and maintain them here.

- **MayDay Problem**

  The second question, known as the MayDay Problem, is sourced from [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlAJtpd3kSI&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E&index=2). It adds an intriguing twist to the problem-solving journey.

- **Generate Three-Digit Numbers**

  The third question involves generating three-digit numbers using only 2 different digits taken from 1 to 9. The challenge is to explore the possibilities of creating these numbers, even allowing repetition of digits. This question can be found in [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D48MKRyQZMA&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E&index=3).

- **Three Number Sum**

  The fourth question, "Three Number Sum," focuses on finding all triplets in an array that sum up to a [target](https://github.com/lee-hen/Algoexpert/tree/master/medium/02_three_number_sum) sum. The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold.

Feel free to explore the solutions, and I hope you find them as enjoyable as I did!
