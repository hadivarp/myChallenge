# My Code Challenge

Welcome to my code challenge repository! Here, I've taken on the task of solving programming problems that have caught my interest. The solutions are implemented in languages I am familiar with, or at least those I believe I understand. These questions are distinct from those found on platforms like Euler Project or LeetCode; instead, they are sourced from various places, often discovered through sources like [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp75eufhOLc&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E).

## Question Sources

- **Dizzy Problem**

  The first set of questions comes from [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp75eufhOLc&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E). As Jadi's repository is not regularly updated, I've chosen to save and maintain them here.

- **MayDay Problem**

  The second question, known as the MayDay Problem, is sourced from [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlAJtpd3kSI&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E&index=2). It adds an intriguing twist to the problem-solving journey.

- **Generate Three-Digit Numbers**

  The third question involves generating three-digit numbers using only 2 different digits taken from 1 to 9. The challenge is to explore the possibilities of creating these numbers, even allowing repetition of digits. This question can be found in [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D48MKRyQZMA&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E&index=3).

Feel free to explore the solutions, and I hope you find them as enjoyable as I did!
