# Programming Problem Repository

In this repository, I have chosen to solve programming problems that I come across, written in languages I am familiar with, or at least those I believe I understand. These questions differ from those found in other sources like Euler Project or LeetCode. In my view, these questions hold value, and I have implemented solutions here for my own enjoyment.

## Question Sources

- **Dizzy Problem**
  
  Regarding the sources of these questions, it's worth mentioning that I discovered them in one of [Jadi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp75eufhOLc&list=PL-tKrPVkKKE3TgSTGMXiIhkqA8Xf7bM3E). Since his repository is not regularly updated, I made the decision to save and maintain them here.
