# Ruby Program to Generate Three-Digit Numbers

## Problem Statement:
How many three-digit numbers can be formed using only 2 different digits from 1 to 9? (Repetition of digits is allowed)

## Overview:
This Ruby program aims to solve the problem of counting three-digit numbers formed with only 2 different digits taken from the range 1 to 9, where repetition of digits is allowed.

## Implementation:
The program utilizes a straightforward approach, iterating through all three-digit numbers from 100 to 999 (inclusive). For each number, it checks if there are exactly 2 unique digits and neither of them is '0'. If these conditions are met, the number is considered valid, and a counter is incremented.

## How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided Ruby code.
3. Run the script in your preferred Ruby environment.
